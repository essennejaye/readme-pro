          ## Description <a name="description"></a> The quality of a README often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase what your application does, justify the technologies used, and even talk about some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future. A good README helps you stand out among the large crowd of developers putting their work on GitHub. This project produces a high-quality, professional README.md with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.
          # The application should be invoked in a node.js command-line environment. However, this application will not be deployed, so it will need to be accessed via my github repository. The npm package Inquirer will need to be installed to run this application.
          # You can quickly and easily generate a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time working on the project. A well- crafted one allows you to show off your work to other developers as well as potential employers.
